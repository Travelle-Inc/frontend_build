1. Run the build command to create the production files:
```bash
npm run build
```
2. This will create a `dist` folder in your project directory.
3. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
4. Drag and drop the `dist` folder onto the page.
5. Netlify will upload and host your site, giving you a shareable URL immediately.
